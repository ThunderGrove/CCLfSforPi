# CCLfSforPi
Set of scripts to cross compile Linux from Scratch

Based on/inspired by Linux from Scratch, Cross Linux from Scratch for POWER (SystemD) and [Cross Linux From Scratch (CLFS) on the Raspberry Pi 4](https://github.com/LeeKyuHyuk/PiCLFS)

NOTE: All steps that are commented out are because the step can not be cross compiled or needs root/fakeroot.
